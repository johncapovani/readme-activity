Changelog
As the name implies, this is a file that contains information about changes and version releases to your project. There are a number of ways to create a changelog. Depending on the sort of project, one method may be more appropriate than another.

Auto-generate a changelog utilizing Github commit messages. You will be able to accomplish this via commit messages already written for a given project, although if conventions were not observed, it may be simpler to start from scratch.
If this method is used, the way in which commit messages are phrased will be very important. Refer to this style guide for conventions when crafting meaningful commit messages.
Information about how to auto-generate a couple different sorts of changelogs can be found in this article published by FreeCodeCamp.
Keep a changelog manually. This is the recommended strategy for this activity, and can be done done easily after work has already been completed on a project.
While initially this may seem like more work, it also gives more immediate control on the construction and methodology of the changelog.
Refer to this helpful guide when choosing a style to manually write your changelog.
